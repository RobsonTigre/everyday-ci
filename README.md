# Data and code for the book Everyday causal inference - Python and R

**The book**: At [everydaycausal.com](https://www.everydaycausal.com) you will learn how to find causal answers to your everyday questions. You don't need any specific background to master the ideas there. Every concept is broken down step-by-step, with relatable examples. 

You can read this book without running the code, but following along with the exercises is the best way to learn. To do that, you’ll need *R or Python* installed.

**Data:** All data used in the book is available in this repository. You can download it manually from the [data folder](https://github.com/RobsonTigre/everyday-ci/tree/main/data) or load it directly by passing the raw URL to `read.csv()` (R) or `pd.read_csv()` (Python).

To load the data directly, use the example URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobsonTigre/everyday-ci/main/data/advertising_data.csv` and replace the filename `advertising_data.csv` with the one you need.
