# Data and code examples in Python and R for "Everyday causal inference"

**Installing R or Python:** You can read this book without running the code, but following along with the exercises is the best way to learn. To do that, you’ll need R or Python installed. If you need a setup guide, see the "Intro" chapter of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html) for R or "Preliminaries" in [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/preliminaries) for Python.

**Data:** All data used in the book is available in this repository. You can download it manually from the [data folder](https://github.com/RobsonTigre/everyday-ci/tree/main/data) or load it directly by passing the raw URL to `read.csv()` (R) or `pd.read_csv()` (Python).

To load the data directly, use the example URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobsonTigre/everyday-ci/main/data/advertising_data.csv` and replace the filename `advertising_data.csv` with the one you need.

**Packages:** You'll need to install a few packages to run the code. While you only need to install them once, remember to load them at the start of every session. Don't worry — each chapter lists exactly what you need.
